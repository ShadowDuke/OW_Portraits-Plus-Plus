# Important Info
**The game is now using [mod.io](https://oldworld.mod.io/) for mod-support in their game which was implemented with the latest patch (20th July).<br>
You can still add them manually like before (github) but it would be certainly easier for you to create a [mod.io](https://oldworld.mod.io/) profile and get the mods and updates for them through the game now.**

# [Portraits++](https://github.com/ShadowDuke/OW_Portraits-Plus-Plus/wiki)
**Adds a total of 37 new adult portraits (28 male and 9 female) from real people transformed to fit into the game. They are added to the pool the game is choosing portraits from. Some nations have been given the same portraits. You can use this with Portraits+**

**Im trying to add new female pictures soon.**
